# Hangman
The classic trivia game we all know and love!  
The game is based on the format of Wheel of Fortune with a Hangman twist.  

Play of the game:
You guess single character each time or the whole phrase at once, if you run out of guesses you'll be, well.. hanged!  
You can choose a question from a variety of categories and three difficulty levels.  
The screen keeps scrolling up so you can hit 'f1' at any point in time to see the question again.  

Enjoy!
